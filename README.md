This InventoryApp is my final submission for Udacity's InventoryApp, Stage 2. This project displays implementing the following:

    Storing information in a SQLite database
    Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
    Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
    Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
    Updating information based on user input
    Creating intents to other apps using stored information
